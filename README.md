ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
Temperature Conversion Formulas
dart// Fahrenheit to Celsius: Â°C = (Â°F - 32) Ã— 5/9
double _fahrenheitToCelsius(double fahrenheit) {
  return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
}

// Celsius to Fahrenheit: Â°F = Â°C Ã— 9/5 + 32
double _celsiusToFahrenheit(double celsius) {
  return celsius * 9 / 5 + 32;
}
